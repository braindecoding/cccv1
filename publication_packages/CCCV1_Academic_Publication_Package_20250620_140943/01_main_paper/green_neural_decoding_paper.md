As neural decoding applications proliferate, the computational cost and environmental impact of brain-computer interface systems become increasingly critical. This paper introduces **Green Neural Decoding** through CortexFlow-CLIP-CNN V1 (CCCV1), demonstrating that high-performance neural decoding can be achieved with significantly reduced computational overhead and carbon footprint. Our analysis reveals that CCCV1 achieves superior performance while maintaining fast inference times (1.26-1.53ms), low memory usage (368-378MB), and minimal carbon emissions (6.59-6.68 kg CO₂). This work establishes a new paradigm for environmentally conscious neural decoding research.
