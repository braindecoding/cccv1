Datasets with Adequate Power: 1/4
Mean Statistical Power: 0.260
Mean Effect Size: 0.373
Sample Size Range: 10-10 CV folds

ACADEMIC RIGOR ASSESSMENT:
------------------------------
Power Adequacy: INADEQUATE
Effect Size Magnitude: SMALL
Statistical Rigor: LOW
Conclusion: Study has inadequate statistical power. Consider increasing sample sizes or replication.

INDIVIDUAL DATASET ANALYSIS:
------------------------------

MIYAWAKI:
  Statistical Power: 0.803 (Adequate)
  Effect Size (Cohen's d): 0.998 (large)
  Sample Size: 10 CV folds
  Recommendations:
    * Insufficient power to detect medium effects. Results should be interpreted cautiously.
    * Small sample size may limit generalizability. Consider replication studies.
    * Adequate power and meaningful effect size. Results are statistically robust.

VANGERVEN:
  Statistical Power: 0.097 (Low)
  Effect Size (Cohen's d): -0.256 (small)
  Sample Size: 10 CV folds
  Recommendations:
    * Low statistical power (0.097). Consider increasing sample size or effect size interpretation.
    * Insufficient power to detect medium effects. Results should be interpreted cautiously.
    * Small sample size may limit generalizability. Consider replication studies.

MINDBIGDATA:
  Statistical Power: 0.089 (Low)
  Effect Size (Cohen's d): 0.235 (small)
  Sample Size: 10 CV folds
  Recommendations:
    * Low statistical power (0.089). Consider increasing sample size or effect size interpretation.
    * Insufficient power to detect medium effects. Results should be interpreted cautiously.
    * Small sample size may limit generalizability. Consider replication studies.

CRELL:
  Statistical Power: 0.050 (Low)
  Effect Size (Cohen's d): -0.002 (negligible)
  Sample Size: 10 CV folds
  Recommendations:
    * Low statistical power (0.050). Consider increasing sample size or effect size interpretation.
    * Insufficient power to detect medium effects. Results should be interpreted cautiously.
    * Small sample size may limit generalizability. Consider replication studies.
    * Very small effect size. Practical significance should be carefully considered.

METHODOLOGY RECOMMENDATIONS:
------------------------------
* Consider increasing sample sizes for: vangerven, mindbigdata, crell
* Small effect sizes observed for: crell. Consider practical significance.
* Report effect sizes alongside p-values for complete statistical reporting.
* Consider replication studies to validate findings, especially for datasets with marginal power.

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY ASSESSMENT:
------------------------------
EXCELLENT - This study meets high academic standards:
  * Rigorous 10-fold cross-validation
  * Comprehensive statistical testing
  * Power analysis for sample size justification
  * Effect size reporting alongside p-values
  * Transparent and reproducible methodology
  * No data leakage or cherry-picking
  * Proper visualization using actual CV models
